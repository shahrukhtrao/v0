## Product Development Framework

This repository contains a structured product development framework with distinct phases:

1. **Ideation** - Concept generation and initial ideas
2. **Research** - Market and user research, competitive analysis
3. **Planning** - Product requirements and project planning
4. **Design** - UX/UI design and prototyping
5. **Development** - Building the product
6. **Testing** - QA, user testing, and validation
7. **Launch** - Product release and go-to-market
8. **Iteration** - Continuous improvement

The `/docs` directory contains detailed documentation about the product development process, including the comprehensive [Product Development Plan](docs/product_development_plan.md).

Each folder represents a phase in the product development lifecycle and contains relevant artifacts for that phase.
