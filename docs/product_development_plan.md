  - Continuous improvement implementation
- **Deliverables**:
  - Product analytics report
  - User feedback summary
  - Prioritized enhancement list
  - Iteration plan
  - Updated product versions

## Iteration Cycle Best Practices

The iteration cycle is critical for continuous product improvement:

1. **Collect User Feedback**
   - Implement feedback mechanisms within the product
   - Conduct regular user interviews and surveys
   - Monitor support tickets and feature requests

2. **Analyze Performance Data**
   - Track key performance indicators (KPIs)
   - Analyze user behavior analytics
   - Identify pain points and drop-offs

3. **Prioritize Improvements**
   - Use frameworks like RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)
   - Balance user needs with business objectives
   - Consider technical constraints and dependencies

4. **Implement Changes**
   - Make incremental improvements
   - Release updates frequently
   - Test changes with a subset of users when possible

5. **Measure Results**
   - Compare performance before and after changes
   - Validate that changes addressed the intended issues
   - Document learnings for future iterations

## Documentation Strategy

All project artifacts will be stored in the appropriate directories:

- `/1_Ideation` - Initial concepts, problem statements
- `/2_Research` - Market research, user research, competitive analysis
- `/3_Planning` - PRDs, timelines, resource plans
- `/4_Design` - Wireframes, mockups, prototypes
- `/5_Development` - Code documentation, technical specs
- `/6_Testing` - Test plans, test results
- `/7_Launch` - Launch plans, marketing materials
- `/8_Iteration` - Feedback analysis, improvement plans
- `/docs` - Central project documentation, including this plan

This structure ensures all team members can easily access relevant information throughout the development process.
