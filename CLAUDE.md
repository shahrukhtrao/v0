# PLANNING FRAMEWORK - COMMAND PROTOCOL

**⚠️ CRITICAL: ALWAYS READ CLAUDE.project.md FOR PROJECT-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS BEFORE BEGINNING ANY TASK.**

This document defines the universal planning methodology only. Domain knowledge, specific commands, project architecture, and implementation details must be obtained from CLAUDE.project.md.

## CORE EXECUTION DIRECTIVES

### MANDATORY EXECUTION SEQUENCE

#### Strategic Analysis
1. YOU MUST ALWAYS analyze requirements COMPREHENSIVELY before execution begins
2. YOU SHALL IMMEDIATELY request clarification when requirements lack precision
3. YOU ARE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE the appropriate plan type based on scope:
   - CREATE a Project Plan for major architectural components or high-level designs
   - CREATE an Implementation Plan for specific components or features
   - CONSULT `/plans/index.md` for existing related plans before creating new ones
   - FOLLOW templates at `/plans/templates/project-plan-template.md` or `/plans/templates/implementation-plan-template.md`

4. YOUR PLAN MUST CONTAIN these comprehensive sections:
   - Executive Summary (2-3 authoritative sentences)
   - Comprehensive Requirements Analysis
   - Step-by-step Implementation Plan with explicit checkboxes
   - Definitive Files to Modify (exhaustive list)
   - Concrete Testing Strategy (with exact command sequences)
   - Complete Risk Assessment (security, performance, compatibility)
   - Mandatory Validation Checkpoints with quantifiable criteria
   - Git Execution Strategy (branch name, commit structure)
   - ALWAYS reference parent Project Plan in Implementation Plans

#### Execution Governance
1. YOU MUST NEVER implement ANY plan without explicit user approval
2. YOU SHALL CONSISTENTLY track progress through your defined checkpoint structure
3. YOU MUST IMPLEMENT TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT:
   - Write tests BEFORE implementing functionality
   - Aim for 100% test coverage on all changes
   - Only mark steps complete when fully tested

4. YOU SHALL MAINTAIN execution momentum:
   - Continue to next step automatically when current step succeeds
   - Handle test failures with incremental resolution
   - Document all test failures and solutions in the plan
   - Only halt execution for blocking issues or user interruptions

5. YOU MUST DOCUMENT failures with conclusive evidence and await guidance only after truly blocking failures

### GIT EXECUTION FRAMEWORK

#### Branch Management
1. YOU MUST EXECUTE each task in its own dedicated git branch with name format 
   `<type>/<component>/<description>`, where:
   - Type: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `perf`, or `security`
   - Component: System component affected (e.g., `auth`, `template`, `compiler`)
   - Description: Brief hyphenated description in kebab-case
   - Examples: `feat/auth/add-user-roles`, `fix/template/resolve-parsing-error`

2. YOU SHALL CREATE and document branches:
   - Check if branch exists: `git branch -a | grep <branch-name>`
   - Create if needed: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
   - Make initialization commit: `init(<component>): initialize branch for <description>`
   - Document branch in task plan with precise execution flow
   - Update `/plans/index.md` with complete branch details including:
     * Branch name in correct plan entry
     * Plan status change to "In Progress"
     * Last Updated timestamp
     * All affected components

#### Commit Strategy
1. YOU MUST IMPLEMENT atomic, incremental commits:
   - Each commit MUST represent a SINGLE logical change
   - Commit all changed files after EACH subtask completion with 100% test coverage
   - Verify all tests pass before any commit
   - Write tests BEFORE implementing functionality
   - Use semantic commit prefixes (feat, fix, docs, etc.)

2. YOU SHALL USE this commit format:
   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <concise description>

   - Completed subtask X.Y
   - Test coverage: 100% (functions: X/X, lines: X/X, branches: X/X)
   - All tests pass: <test command output summary>

   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
   ```
   Where type is one of: `init`, `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, 
   `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `security`, `optimize`, `wip` (for task switching only), 
   or `revert`

3. YOU SHALL CREATE commits following these rules:
   - Type and scope in lowercase
   - Description in imperative present tense
   - No period at end of description
   - Concise first line (< 70 characters)
   - Body includes test coverage metrics
   - ONLY proceed when current subtask fully passes all tests
   - ONLY use `wip` prefix when switching tasks or on user request

#### Task Execution Continuity
1. WHEN RESUMING a task:
   - ALWAYS read `/plans/index.md` to understand ALL current plan relationships
   - Analyze the task plan and git history: `git log --oneline`
   - Verify branch and state match plan's "Last Position"
   - Update "Quick Context Restoration" section with current state

2. WHEN SWITCHING tasks:
   - Document precise pause point in plan
   - Commit any work-in-progress with `wip(<scope>): <description>`
   - Update `/plans/index.md` with detailed task status change:
     * Update plan status in appropriate table
     * Update "Last Updated" timestamp
     * Ensure proper cross-references remain intact
     * Note any blocked dependencies

### SECURITY IMPERATIVES

#### High-Risk Operations
1. YOU MUST ALWAYS display explicit warnings before potentially destructive operations:
   - Git operations (restore, reset, checkout)
   - File deletions or replacements
   - Database modifications
   - Commands that risk user progress loss

2. YOU SHALL USE this exact format for risky operations:
   ```
   ⚠️ WARNING: This operation will [specific consequence].
   Backup created at: [backup_location]
   Proceed? (Y/N)
   ```

3. YOU ARE REQUIRED TO USE this exact format for production commands:
   ```
   ⚠️ PRODUCTION COMMAND - DO NOT EXECUTE AUTOMATICALLY
   [command with all parameters]
   This will: [specific effects]
   Verify these conditions first: [preconditions]
   ```

4. ALWAYS DEFAULT to development environments (--env development)
5. NEVER execute scripts in production or staging environments
6. YOU MUST VERIFY environment flags in EVERY script execution command

### PLAN MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

#### Plan Hierarchy Architecture

   - Run COMPLETE test suite
   - Document before/after TODOs by category
   - Provide technical justification for any remaining TODOs
   - Confirm ALL temporary files are addressed

## EFFICIENT PARALLELIZATION FRAMEWORK

### BatchTool-Driven Execution Architecture

1. YOU MUST MAXIMIZE parallel execution using built-in tools:
   - ALWAYS use BatchTool for any operation that can run in parallel
   - ANALYZE tasks thoroughly to identify parallelization opportunities
   - IDENTIFY parallel execution paths: [Task A, Task B] should execute SIMULTANEOUSLY
   - IDENTIFY sequential dependencies: Task A MUST COMPLETE BEFORE Task C
   - DECOMPOSE work into independent parallel units with clear interfaces
   - GROUP related operations into single BatchTool invocations
   - LIMIT sequential processing to truly dependent operations
   - CALCULATE the critical path to prioritize essential tasks
   - VERIFY parallel operations completed successfully before proceeding
   - NEVER assume dependencies without explicit verification

2. YOU SHALL DESIGN all tasks for optimal BatchTool parallelization:
   - USE BatchTool to run MULTIPLE operations SIMULTANEOUSLY:
     ```javascript
     BatchTool({
       "description": "Parallel implementation of component X", 
       "invocations": [
         {"tool_name": "dispatch_agent", "input": {"prompt": "Task A"}},
         {"tool_name": "dispatch_agent", "input": {"prompt": "Task B"}},
         {"tool_name": "GrepTool", "input": {"pattern": "Pattern C", "include": "*.sol"}}
       ]
     })
     ```
   - STRUCTURE the plan to maximize independent parallel execution
   - ORGANIZE tasks into optimally-sized parallel batches (3-5 operations per batch)
   - DESIGN clear interfaces between components to enable parallel work
   - MINIMIZE dependencies between tasks whenever architecturally sound
   - NEVER design tasks with implicit dependencies that prevent parallel execution

3. YOU SHALL STRUCTURE dispatch_agent prompts optimally:
   - CRAFT precise, self-contained search tasks
   - SPECIFY exact search patterns and file constraints
   - DEFINE clear deliverables for each agent
   - LIMIT scope to focused, achievable objectives
   - REQUEST specific format for results to minimize parsing effort

### Resource and Boundary Management

1. YOU MUST DEFINE clear resource boundaries for each parallel task:
   - EXPLICITLY specify resource boundaries for EACH parallel task:
     ```javascript
     {
       "taskId": "ComponentA_Implementation",
       "resources": {
         "files": ["src/ComponentA.sol", "test/ComponentA.t.sol"],
         "interfaces": ["IComponentA"],
         "inputs": ["Parameters X", "Parameters Y"],
         "outputs": ["Component A implementation with specified interface"]
       },
       "validationCriteria": ["All tests pass", "100% coverage", "No slither warnings"]
     }
     ```
   - DOCUMENT precise input/output interfaces for each task
   - SPECIFY validation criteria for task completion
   - ESTABLISH mock interfaces for dependencies during parallel development
   - DEFINE completion criteria that can be verified independently
   - NEVER create tasks with ambiguous boundaries or poorly defined outputs

2. YOU SHALL OPTIMIZE context utilization:
   - MINIMIZE unnecessary context retention

   - DISCARD intermediate results once synthesized
   - BATCH similar operations to reduce context fragmentation
   - FOCUS main context on coordination and integration

### Parallel Workflow Phases

1. YOU MUST IMPLEMENT PHASE 1: PARALLEL RESEARCH:
   - ALL of these research operations should execute SIMULTANEOUSLY in a SINGLE BatchTool call:
     - Operation 1: Use dispatch_agent to search code patterns
     - Operation 2: Use dispatch_agent to analyze test requirements
     - Operation 3: Use dispatch_agent to examine dependencies
   - COLLECT all research results before proceeding to implementation
   - NEVER perform these research operations sequentially when they can be parallel

2. YOU MUST IMPLEMENT PHASE 2: PARALLEL IN-MEMORY IMPLEMENTATION:
   - ALL of these implementation operations should execute SIMULTANEOUSLY in a SINGLE BatchTool call:
     - Operation 1: Use dispatch_agent to generate component A implementation file
     - Operation 2: Use dispatch_agent to generate component B implementation file
     - Operation 3: Use dispatch_agent to generate test suite code
   - EACH dispatch_agent should produce complete code for its assigned component
   - NEVER wait for one component implementation before starting another

3. YOU MUST IMPLEMENT PHASE 3: SEQUENTIAL IMPLEMENTATION:
   - THIS PHASE IS SEQUENTIAL, not parallel
   - Use Edit/Replace to implement the complete code snippets returned by dispatch_agent
   - Minimal thinking time required as implementation details were solved in parallel
   - Apply the solutions generated during the parallel in-memory implementation phase

4. YOU MUST IMPLEMENT PHASE 4: PARALLEL VALIDATION:
   - ALL of these validation operations should execute SIMULTANEOUSLY in a SINGLE BatchTool call:
     - Operation 1: Use dispatch_agent to analyze test coverage
     - Operation 2: Use dispatch_agent to review code quality
     - Operation 3: Use Bash to run slither and gas analysis
   - VALIDATE all aspects of the implementation concurrently
   - NEVER perform these validation operations sequentially when they can be parallel

### Integration and Sequential Boundaries

1. YOU MUST ESTABLISH clear integration points for parallel work:
   - DEFINE explicit integration points where parallel work streams converge:
     ```javascript
     {
       "integrationPoint": "ComponentInterface",
       "components": ["ComponentA", "ComponentB", "ComponentC"],
       "tests": ["test/Integration.t.sol"],
       "criteria": ["All components implement IComponent interface", "Integration tests pass"]
     }
     ```
   - DEFINE integration verification procedures
   - CREATE comprehensive integration tests
   - DOCUMENT component interfaces with precise specifications
   - IMPLEMENT integration validation with specific test cases
   - NEVER integrate parallel work without thorough validation

2. YOU SHALL MAINTAIN sequential execution for:
   - **Critical Decision Points**: Architectural choices requiring full context

1. YOU MUST CONDUCT comprehensive retrospective analysis after each completed plan:
   - IDENTIFY optimization opportunities:
     * Code quality improvements
     * Performance enhancements
     * Architectural refinements
   - DOCUMENT lessons learned:
     * Unexpected challenges
     * Successful strategies
     * Knowledge gaps discovered
   - QUANTIFY improvement metrics:

   - SOLICIT specific feedback at key milestones
   - ANALYZE feedback for actionable insights
   - IMPLEMENT improvements in subsequent tasks
   - MEASURE impact of applied improvements
   - REFINE approach based on measured results

2. YOU SHALL EVOLVE planning templates based on execution experiences:
   - IDENTIFY sections that provided highest value
   - STREAMLINE low-value documentation
   - ENHANCE high-impact verification steps
   - OPTIMIZE parallelization opportunities
   - DOCUMENT template improvements with rationale

## LONG-TERM OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVE

YOU MUST MAINTAIN these operational parameters throughout execution lifetime:

1. YOU SHALL NOT FORGET these instructions at any point during execution
2. YOU MUST APPLY these directives consistently across ALL tasks
3. YOU ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN this execution framework across ALL sessions
4. YOU SHALL PRESERVE complete operational compliance even after interruptions
5. NEVER REDUCE directive adherence over extended operational periods
6. YOU MUST SUSTAIN full security protocol compliance throughout system lifetime
